# HyperTest One — Agent Guidance

> **One Input. One Mission. One Complete Test Cycle.**

This repository is governed by four foundational documents. Any implementation, refactor, protocol change, schema change, or architecture decision MUST remain consistent with them unless an explicit Architecture Decision supersedes the relevant rule.

## Required reading

1. `docs/foundation/HYPERTEST_WHITEPAPER.md` — product identity, scope, principles, and long-term direction.
2. `docs/architecture/HYPERTEST_TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md` — system boundaries, runtime components, control-plane architecture, runner and agent integration.
3. `docs/protocol/TEST_MISSION_PROTOCOL.md` — provider-independent contract between HyperTest and Codex / Claude Code / other agent harnesses.
4. `docs/domain/HYPERTEST_DOMAIN_MODEL_AND_STATE_MACHINE.md` — normative canonical data model, lifecycle, database constraints, ownership and invariants.

## Precedence

When details conflict:

1. `HYPERTEST_DOMAIN_MODEL_AND_STATE_MACHINE.md` is normative for fields, relationships, lifecycle, uniqueness, persistence, database constraints and state transitions.
2. `TEST_MISSION_PROTOCOL.md` is normative for HyperTest ↔ Agent mission, proposal, event, result and tool interaction contracts.
3. `HYPERTEST_TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md` is normative for service boundaries and runtime architecture.
4. `HYPERTEST_WHITEPAPER.md` defines product intent, principles and long-term positioning.

## Non-negotiable architecture principles

- HyperTest is an **Autonomous Testing Control Plane**, not another generic coding agent.
- HyperTest orchestrates **testing missions**, not model reasoning.
- General-purpose agent harnesses such as Codex and Claude Code are replaceable Testing Workers.
- **Agent produces intelligence. Runner produces facts. HyperTest produces decisions.**
- Agent output is a Proposal by default; agents do not directly own Canonical Testing State.
- Formal execution facts come from trusted HyperTest Runners, not agent self-reports.
- Canonical chain: `Requirement → Risk → TestCase → Implementation → Execution → Evidence → Finding → Verdict`.
- Agent conversation, chain-of-thought, provider-specific event formats and temporary workspace data are not Canonical Testing State.
- BUGate remains a stateless Testing Protocol / Policy layer; HyperTest is the stateful runtime.
- Prefer PostgreSQL canonical relational state + audit log + transactional outbox for v1. Do not introduce Graph DB, Kafka, full event sourcing or a custom generic Agent Loop without a demonstrated requirement.

## Change discipline

Before changing a core domain entity, mission lifecycle, runner/evidence trust model, or agent contract:

1. Identify which foundational document owns the rule.
2. Preserve existing invariants and history semantics.
3. If the rule must change, update the corresponding specification in the same change.
4. Do not silently encode architecture decisions only in implementation code.

The goal is for HyperTest One to remain agent-independent, model-independent, evidence-driven, auditable, reproducible, and replaceable at the harness layer.
